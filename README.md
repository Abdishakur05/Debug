## Design

### Colour Scheme
* Bisque 
* Brown

Brown and bisque was chose because together they convey a grounded, natural feel.
Bisque adds a delicate elegance, while brown is linked to reliability and support. When combined, they produce a refined yet approachable appearance.

### Typography
* Dancing Script - I used Dancing Script as a font for headers because it has a lively, flowing style that adds a personal, creative touch to the headings. It feels less formal and more friendly, which suits the lounge vibe of the website.
  The font was chosen to ensure the text and interactive elements are easy to read without being overly harsh or straining to the eyes.
* Playfair Display - Playfair Display's was used as a font  for text because the website appears more sophisticated and professional because to the gorgeous serif font. Establishing reputation and trust is crucial.

## Features
### Responsitivity on all devices ![View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abdishakur05/Debug/main/Modern%20Gaming%20Cover%20YouTube%20Channel%20Art.png "Modern Gaming Cover")

### Header 
The header contains the title of the website "The Debug Lounge". Beside it contains each of the links of the page which when clicked upon locates the user to the section of the site. I kept the nav bar simple so it can be user friendly. When the screen is decreased the navbar turns into a sidebar. This doesnt not only keep the clean and simple look of the nav bar but makes it easier to navigate making it user friendly.

### Footer
The footer includes information like how to contact us. It includes the social links which when clicked locates the users to our social media sites. Our location is stated in the footer so the user can navigate where we our located. Opening and Closing times is stated in the footer. The footer folds when the size of the screen decreases which keeps its clean design
